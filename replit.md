# Overview

This is a D&D-themed component library and Liferay fragment reference application built with React. The project serves as a showcase and documentation tool for reusable UI components designed with a fantasy/medieval aesthetic, featuring dark browns, gold accents, and ornate styling. The application displays both standalone React components and Liferay fragment collections that can be used in Liferay portal development.

## Recent Updates (October 31, 2025)

### DM Chat - Persistent Conversation System ‚≠ê
- **Character-based Chat History**: Each character maintains separate conversation history
